                    CarSooq team understands that buying a car is a significant
                    and impactful life decision. Therefore, we like to know our
                    customers and taking the time to build a meaningful, long-term
                    relationship. We interview our customers because we believe in
                    establishing or re-establishing a positive credit history, to
                    benefit them -not only on the short term- on the long term as
                    well.
